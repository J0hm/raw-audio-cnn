You MUST run `python3 -m venv .venv`, `. start_venv.sh`, and then `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` before using any of the scripts or models in this repository. If you wish to use Visdom for data visualization, run `visdom` in the venv.
Currently, M5 and VGG16 are supported. Tests and examples are in m5_test.py and vgg16_test.py.
