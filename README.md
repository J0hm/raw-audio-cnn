# Various CNN architecture implementations for raw signal/audio classification
You MUST run `python3 -m venv .venv`, `. start_venv.sh`, and then `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` before using any of the scripts or models in this repository. If you wish to use Visdom for data visualization, run `visdom` in the venv.

Currently, M5, M11, M18 and VGG16 are supported, with more on the way.

`validate.py` is yet to be full implemented, but `train.py` is. Run with the argument `-h` to see possible options.
